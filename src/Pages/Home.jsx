                The Cistern is building a virtual research space that brings
                together a wide range of geographical books, atlases, land
                descriptions, and maps produced between the 15th and early
                20th-centuries. Initially rare artifacts, these objects
                gradually became part of everyday life, reflecting the rise of
                territorialized states, intensifying militarization, and sweep
                capitalization of international economies. This project gathers
                a team of research assistants and student programmers to
                investigate the history of modern mapping as it became part of
                everyday life from paper maps and pocket atlases to aerial
                photography, satellite imagery, drones, and GPS. It archives
                this historical process in a database of images and books on the
                geography of the Middle East, focusing initially on Ottoman
                Turkish, Arabic, English and French publications and cultural
                artifacts. A research team laid the foundations of a searchable
                engine and experimented with a 3D research room prototype. The
                searchable database incorporates existing bibliographical
                repositories, reframing them to respond to the needs of current
                users across fields and disciplines. It reorients the history of
                science and technology by curating objects and instruments
                alongside people rather than great personalities and
                groundbreaking machines. The methodology raises questions of
                gender, authority, knowledge production, marginality, and
                transnationalism. This tool is housed in a virtual space that
                has the basic architecture of a cistern, a calm underground
                space sustaining a bustling city. The pairing of academic
                research with a virtual research space aims to generate
                innovative thought-processes and research questions while at the
                same time offering a new kind of immersive environment that is
                conducive to attention (de)focusing, collaborative learning, and
                creative ignition.
